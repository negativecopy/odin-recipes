        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>New York Strip Steak</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Rosemary</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Score the steak's fat cap with a sharp knife to prevent the steak from curling as it cooks.</li>
                <li>Season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper -- the more seasoning, the more flavorful the crust will be!</li>
                <li>Heat the cast-iron skillet on the stove top until just before it begins to smoke.</li>
                <li>Use tongs to sear the fat cap first -- hold the steak in place and press the fat cap into the skillet.</li>
                <li>After the fat has partially melted, rest the steak on one side in the pan. Without moving it, let it cook on high for three minutes.</li>
                <li>Flip the steak to cook on the other side for an additional three minutes.</li>
                <li>Flip the steak onto the first side, and add the butter and minced garlic to the pan.</li>
                <li>Place the rosemary on top of the steak. As it cooks for two minutes on this side, spoon the melted butter and minced garlic over top of the steak.</li>
                <li>Remove the rosemary before flipping the steak onto the other side to cook for two more minutes. After flipping it, replace the rosemary on top of the steak. Continue to spoon the butter and garlic over top.</li>
                <li>Finally, remove the steak from the skillet and place it on a place under tented tin foil. Let it continue to cook for a few more minutes.</li>
                <li>After the steak has rested for a few minutes, serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
